## <p style="text-align: center;">HyperParameter Tuning</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">In this Jupyter notebook, we will be optimizing a simple three layered Feed-Forward Neural Network and perform hyperparameter tuning in order to obtain a high-performing model. The simple MNIST-IRIS dataset will be used for this demonstration. We shall be tuning our Model based on Training Vs Validation Error plots </p>
